Another big update.  The carousel has been themed and pixel art icon has been drawn for every system.  To see see the updated carousel you will need to update to the very latest version of Retropie via the Retropie setup script https://github.com/retropie/retropie-setup/wiki/updating-retropie
On older versions of retropie the carousel will revert to the old style.

6 new systems have been added Daphne,PSP, SG-1000, Atari Lynx, Ports, and Virtual Boy.

'OUR BOX ART IS IN ANOTHER CASTLE' image has been reduced in size to hopefully prevent it showing behind some artwork and has been completely removed from the config screen.

Large number of changes.  Layout has been changed to support preview art of any size/aspect ratio without stretching.  Additionally a new system has been implemented to allow the end user to pick from a selection of 24 different metadata layouts.  3 new systems have been added, Odyssey 2, Nintendo DS, and Arcade.

Fixed system logos not showing on latest version of Retropie.
Updated gamelist font so that special characters are displayed (accented characters will only show as standard characters).
Updated description font to add alternative apostrophe character.

9/03/2017
Edited several charcters in the gamelist font to more accurately match the font used by nintendo.
Added 12 new systems

10/03/2017 
Changed folder colors to match selector bar color as they were black on a black background.  Edited the font to replace the @ symbol with a folder icon, now if you name you folders with an @ followed by a space and then the folder name it will display a little folder icon on the game list. eg instead of a folder named 'Puzzle' you would name the folder '@ Puzzle'.

11/03/2017 
Updated gamelist font so that the folder icon now replaces the # symbol.  This means if you name your folder for example "# Puzzle" it will be shown with a folder icon and all folders will appear at the top of the list when sorted alphabetically.
